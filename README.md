# ReadMe Generator
## Description
One of the most time-consuming and tedious tasks associated with web development is the crafting of a ReadMe document, but it's also one of the most important steps in the process. A readme allows users to better understand how your application works and what it does. The ReadMe Generator prompts the user with specific questions and populates an existing readme template with this useful data

This application will ultimately save time in the development process leading to future advancements within the application rather than time spent mechanically crafting a readme document. Ultimately, it also provides uniformity to future readme documentation for any future projects.

## Installation
The only steps necessary to install this project are to run "npm install inquirer@8.2.4 in your terminal once you have access to the application. This will allow the inquirer script to run in Node. Outside of this, the project should run just if the user types "node index.js" in the terminal command line

## Usage
This project can be used to follow traditional readme standards while quickly presenting the developer with prompt questions that will accurately (and quickly) populate the readme with useful data.

## License
No license used

## Contributing

Outside assets I used on this project: Node.JS and Inquirer v 8.2.4
    
## Tests
This project does not require any testing, but if any user wants to try it out, they can simply run the application by entering "node index.js" in their command line
